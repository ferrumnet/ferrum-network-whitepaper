# Ferrum Runtime

### Background and Overview

The value proposition and use case for Ferrum's mainnet has evolved since Ferrum's inception in 2018. As the crypto landscape evolves, the team at Ferrum Network has dedicated tremendous effort to ensure that the Ferrum Network mainnet continues to adapt and evolve to provide limitless utility and value to all stakeholders.&#x20;

### Joining Polkadot’s Bet Against Blockchain Maximalism

> The days of [chain maximalism](../glossary-and-acronyms/glossary.md#chain-maximalism) are over. Ferrum Network believes in a multi-chain future and is joining [Polkadot in their bet against blockchain maximalism](https://cointelegraph.com/news/gavin-wood-polkadot-is-a-bet-against-blockchain-maximalism). Ferrum Network was founded on the basis of an interoperable world; we believe an alignment with the Polkadot ecosystem is the ideal next step in our journey to help make blockchain interoperability as seamless as a MetaMask transaction.

### Ferrum Network Tech Stack Overview

### Why Polkadot?

#### Mission Alignment

Polkadot set out to build a multi-chain world with their [_HETEROGENEOUS MULTI-CHAIN FRAMEWORK_](https://polkadot.network/PolkaDotPaper.pdf)_._ Ferrum is a strong believer and proponent of Polkadot's bet against chain maximalism. We feel that Ferrum's mission aligns perfectly with Polkadot's core ethos. We also believe that the DotSama community is ideally suited to undertake the task of creating, adopting, and standardizing interoperability across chains. For these reasons, we feel the DotSama ecosystem is the ideal and nurturing environment for the inception and growth of Ferrum's blockchains.

#### Why Reinvent The Wheel - Early Chain Attacks

> An attacker could double-spend through a "51% attack" in which the attacker amasses a majority of the hashrate on the target cryptocurrency.

> Reference: [MIT Media Lab](https://dci.mit.edu/51-attacks)

Newer blockchains are more susceptible to 51% attacks as it's cheaper and typically easier to acquire enough tokens to control over 50% of the blockchain's hashrate. Other consensus mechanisms have sought to solve this problem. However, Polkadot's solution is novel and unique in the sense that they have virtually eliminated the likely hood of a 51% attack from parachains by introducing the concept of [_**shared security**_](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-architecture#shared-security)_._ Through this novel concept, parachains are able to rely on the security of the Polkadot or Kusama relay chains and their validators instead of amassing or relying on their own validator/miner network. This means even new parachains benefit from the security of an established Polkadot and Kusama relay chain.&#x20;

This security advantage was another major factor in our decision to build Ferrum in the DotSama ecosystem.

### Stack Overview

Brief of VCPR, QP, MCV

Ferrum intends to bring the power and benefits of Polkadot and its cousin Kusama to the rest of the world. Polkadot's has proven the importance and demand of their core [_HETEROGENEOUS MULTI-CHAIN FRAMEWORK_](https://polkadot.network/PolkaDotPaper.pdf) __ with incredible adoption and a fast-growing market cap that has surpassed $35.5 Billion, and is in the Top 10 coins by market cap as of 29-November-2021. Ferrum Network is bringing this amazing core technology to address the problems faced by every project in crypto with a combined potential market size to be addressed currently valued at $2.57 Trillion and growing.
