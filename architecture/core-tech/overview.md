## Background and Overview

The value proposition and use case for Ferrum's mainnet has evolved since Ferrum's inception in 2018. As the crypto landscape evolves, the team at Ferrum Network has dedicated tremendous effort to ensure that the Ferrum Network mainnet continues to adapt and evolve to provide limitless utility and value to all stakeholders.&#x20;

## Ferrum Network Tech Stack Overview

## The Core Stack

Ferrum mainnet is developed in [_RUST_](https://www.rust-lang.org/) using the [Substrate Framework](https://substrate.io/). Ferrum Network will be deployed as a parachain on the Polkadot Relay chain after securing a parachain slot through the [Polkadot Parachain Auction process](https://parachains.info/auctions). The following components make up the core tech behind Ferrum Network

1. The Chain
2. RUST programming language
3. Substrate Framework
4. Ferrum Runtime
5. Quantum Portal
6. Value Constrained PoS Rollup
7. Multi-Chain Validators

### The Chain

Ferrum Network is a Turing complete blockchain with a smart contract-enabled platform. The chain is responsible for facilitating use cases such as the Quantum Portal, FIBER, FORGE, and limitless other use cases to be developed by Ferrum and open-source contributors in the future. The validation of transactions and their immutability is secured by the Polkadot Relay chain.&#x20;

We have made significant efforts to simplify our implementation ensuring easy extensibility and further development of the network itself as well as deployment of dApps and solutions on the network.

### Why do you need Ferrum Network?

Without Ferrum Network projects and developers would rely on the current infrastructure for deploying MultiChain dApps. This would require one of the following scenarios:

1. Projects hire multiple developers with expertise in each network and it's native programming language for building
2. Developers working for projects take time to learn the new programming languages for each network they need to deploy their dApps on

Both of these options come with a heave time and capital cost resulting with weary and unhappy community members and investors. This starts a never-ending cycle of update requests from the community, pushing unachievable deadlines on the devs, and a mountain of stress on the project managers as they see their treasuries deplete with every passing month.&#x20;

> Ferrum Network helps projects efficiently deploy their capital by providing tooling that accelerates the time it takes for projects to get their MultiChain product to market.&#x20;

With Ferrum Network developers are only required to learn one language if they wish to customize the deployment implementations. In most cases, developers can utilize Ferrum Network's tooling to deploy from their native chain using the programming language they are most familiar with, Ferrum network takes care of the grunt work in the background through its integration infrastructure. The contrast in effort can be seen in the two illustrations below.

Before we get into the details of our core tech, let's explore why we decided to build Ferrum in the DotaSama ecosystem.
