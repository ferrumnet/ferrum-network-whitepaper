### **General-Purpose Blockchains**

General-Purpose Blockchains are generally touring complete blockchains that are not solving an application-specific problem, but rather give a platform for builders to deploy their applications and solutions.&#x20;

### **Purpose-Built Blockchains**

These blockchains are typically built to solve a specific problem. Also known as application-specific blockchains. Some examples are Algorand which is a blockchain dedicated to the financial settlement of assets. Cudos is a blockchain dedicated to solving the problem of decentralized cloud computing services. See General-Purpose Blockchains for contrast in approach between Purpose-Built and General Purpose blockchains.
