# Ferrum Network Mission

### Removing Barriers to Mass Adoption of Crypto

Ferrum Network is designed to remove barriers to the mass adoption of crypto and the underlying technologies that power the industry. Ferrum Network was born in the bear market to provide solutions that provide tremendous value regardless of the market cycle to projects operating across networks.&#x20;

### Ferrum Network Origins and Why the Name Ferrum

The name Ferrum is the Latin term for Iron. We chose the name Ferrum due to Iron's ability to fuse with and form a limitless variety of materials essential for the sustenance of life itself. We feel our mission is homogeneous to these characteristics of element 26. At Ferrum Network, we are building solutions that conform to various complex protocols, many of which have nothing in common except for their interoperability with Ferrum Network.

### Interoperability by Design

Ferrum Network's sophisticated solutions simplify the complexity of building a multi-chain solution and give developers and project owners a single entry point to every recognizable chain and network in the industry. We have thought about the pain points that arise when implementing interoperability as an afterthought in a multi-network / multi-chain world. With an ever-growing list of new EVM and non-EVM compatible chains coming to market, gaining traction, and providing value to segments of the global crypto audience, interoperability has become a core value for most projects. At Ferrum Network, we design from the ground up for interoperability.

### **Developability — Making life easier for developers**

> “Although developability is critical for blockchain platforms, it is not often discussed. We think about usability a lot when we talk about product design, however for application platforms developability is the most important thing to attract developers to get apps built and put onto the platform.” **** — [@Polkadot](https://twitter.com/polkadotnetwork)&#x20;

#### Why Should You Care?

As a developer, you no longer need to figure out architectural problems that come from launching your dApp, game, or metaverse on an EVM-compatible network like Polygon and providing seamless integration to a non-EVM compatible network like Solana.

Build the core solution on Ferrum Network and leave the complexity of seamless multi-chain integration to the underlying technology. Ferrum Network lets you implement interactions that enable the multi-chain transfer of value, data, and functional components. All of this is compiled and presented to the end-users in a seamless experience.

Ferrum Network's sophisticated interoperability protocols allow you to engage audiences across the spectrum regardless of their core stack, consensus mechanism, or runtime environment. As a developer, you can accomplish this without having to learn about the nuances of deploying your dApp or game on each of these individual networks. Gain mastery over one protocol, Ferrum Network, and access every network where your audience natively engages.
