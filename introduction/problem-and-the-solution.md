# Problem and the Solution

The name Ferrum is the Latin term for Iron. We chose the name Ferrum due to Iron's ability to fuse with and form a limitless variety of materials essential for the sustenance of life itself. We feel our mission is homogeneous to these characteristics of element 26.  At Ferrum Network we are building solutions that conform to a variety of complex protocols, many of which have nothing in common except for their interoperability with Ferrum Network.

Teams building solutions today are regularly forced to compromise on the benefits of a truly multi-network ecosystem. Even projects that have deployed their token, and dApps on multiple networks continue to have a siloed experience for their community, holders, and development process.

Polkadot's architecture of a primary relay chain with interconnected parachains solves the infrastructure side of this problem for those within the Polkadot ecosystem. However, for everyone else not part of the Polkadot ecosystem, there is still no viable solution. Ferrum Network is able to solve the problem of interoperability of value and data for any network, including parachains, EVM compatible networks, non-EVM compatible networks, or any other variation in the future.
