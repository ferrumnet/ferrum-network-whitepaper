## Voting Eligibility and Process

In our DAO governance structure, your vote matters. To participate in voting on proposals, you must have cFRM staked in the cFRM BSC or cFRM Arbitrum staking pools. Learn more details in our dedicated Voting Eligibility and Process section.

## Proposal Creation

The criteria for creating proposals is significantly higher to ensure the integrity of our governance process. Currently, it requires a 450,000 combined staked balance between FRM GC Arbitrum Pool, cFRM BSC Pool, and cFRM Arbitrum Pool to qualify to create proposals. Learn more details in our dedicated Proposal Creation section.
