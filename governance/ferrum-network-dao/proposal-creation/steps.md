# Steps

## Step 1 - Create Proposal Suggestion

Any `qualified voter` can create a proposal suggestion in Discord `dao-proposal` forum.\
A `qualified voter` must have at least 1 cFRM in the BSC or Arbitrum Crucible Open Staking Pools.\


1. Must check existing proposals by searching forum to ensure it’s not a duplicate
2. Must follow [Proposal Suggestion Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KWyIue0j64Zcoyo-chDzRvykDZq9-cCEDDpX5ewUllw/edit?usp=sharing)
3. If 1. and 2. are not followed `dao-mods` will delete the proposal
4. The proposal suggestion creator can also create a ticket in `mod-support` with a link to this post to expedite the status update.

## Step 2 - Mod Review and Submission for Community Review &#x20;

A `dao-mod` reviews the proposal, assigns prop-suggestion number `frc-sug-1` and assigns the tag Discussion indicating to the community that the proposal is now open for discussion.

1. At this point marketing can also push the proposal in announcements etc to let the community know that a new proposal suggestion has been submitted and can be reviewed.
2. The `prop-sug number` will be added to the title of the proposal in this format: \[`frc-sug-1`] Title

## Step 3 - Gain Community Buy In

It is now the proposal suggestion creator and proposal supporters' job to gain community buy in and get traction by engaging the community in the discussion. Once the proposal suggestion creator feels there is enough interest, they can create a post in their proposal tagging `dao-mods` to create a Pulse Check poll. The proposal creator should also submit a ticket in `mod-support` and provide a link to this Pulse Check post to expedite the Pulse Check request.&#x20;

## Step 4 - Pulse Check

A `dao-mod` will review the request, and create a Pulse Check Poll “Should we send `frc-sug-1` for an official vote?” with voting options “yes” and “no”. This Pulse Check poll will be open for 5 days and requires 50 votes with majority yes votes to pass.\
\
a. If the Pulse check fails, the proposal is archived, assigned a Pulse Check Failed tag a post is made with the date the failed tag was assigned and a similar proposal cannot be raised again for a 30 day period.\
b. If the Pulse check passes then we proceed to the next stage

## Step 5 - Ready for Voting

After the Pulse Check passes the `dao-mod` will update the status to Ready For Voting by assigning the tag and notify qualified-proposal-creators that they may submit the proposal for official voting on snapshot. \
\
a. The `dao-mod` will also assign a proposal number to this proposal suggestion now that it has passed the Pulse Check. The proposal number will be in this format `FRC-1`. This number shall be added to the Title of the topic in this format \[`FRC-1`] Title.

## Step 6 - Proposal Creation

At this point  `qualified-proposal-creators` may pick up the proposal and submitted it for an official vote on snapshot. They must follow the [Proposal Template](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1QbZhyn3-a2X85jDsecPs\_e1hsnLMbupk8tlHMepGcq0/edit) (also available in snapshot) and include a link to the Discord topic in the discussion section of the snapshot proposal creation process.\
\
a. After creating the proposal in snapshot, the `qualified-proposal-creator`s must return to the Discord `dao-proposals` forum and add a link to the snapshot proposal and tag `dao-mods` to update the status to Waiting Period. The `qualified-proposal-creators` must also create a ticket in `mod-support` with a link to this post to expedite the status update.

## Step 7 - Waiting Period

Once `dao-mods` update the status to Waiting Period, marketing can assist proposal creators and supporters by announcing the proposal with snapshot link and discussion link to notify the community to get involved in the discussion and get ready to participate in the upcoming vote.

## Step 8 - Voting Period

The `dao-mod` who set the status to Waiting Period for this proposal must set a reminder to update the status to Voting Period once the Waiting Period (currently 7 days after proposal creation on snapshot) is over. dao-mods should get the exact time from the snapshot proposal itself and all times must be shared in UTC in the following format: 29-May-2023 at 14:30 UTC\
\
a. During the voting period marketing and proposal creators can assist in sharing the proposal to get the community involved. \
b. Proposals require 20,000,000 cFRM/FRM voting Power to form a quorum and pass i.e. if less than 20,000,000 cFRM/FRM staked holders vote a proposal will automatically fail due to a lack of a quorum.

## Step 9 - Approve or Deny

At the end of the voting period a proposal is either Approved or Denied, the proposal creator can notify the `dao-mods` to update the status by adding a message to the post in the proposal in Discord. The proposal creator must also create a ticket in `mod-support` to expedite this request.

## Step 10 - Execution of Proposal

The executing party must execute the proposal per the terms defined in the proposals Execution Plan section.
