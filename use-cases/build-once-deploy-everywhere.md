# Build Once, Deploy Everywhere

Ferrum Network and Quantum Portal's unique solution allows projects to build smart contracts and applications once and use Ferrum Network and Quantum Portal to deploy it everywhere.&#x20;

## Build once, deploy everywhere

Launching an ERC20 token on Ethereum, BSC, and Polygon would require building and deploying an ERC20 contract on each chain separately. For example, to launch an ERC20 token on Ethereum, a developer would need to create and deploy an ERC20 smart contract on the Ethereum network. Similarly, for BSC and Polygon, separate contracts would need to be built and deployed on their respective networks. Managing the supply of the token across all these networks would prove to be a challenge as any change in the token supply on one network would require changes to be made on other networks via bridges. This could be a time-consuming and costly process, and keeping track of all the changes across multiple networks can quickly become complicated and prone to errors.

However, with Multichain token and Ferrum's solutions, developers can build one token and deploy it across multiple chains with a connected supply that is easily managed and kept up to date. With Ferrum's Quantum Portal, developers can use the same contract code to deploy on multiple chains. For example, a developer can create an ERC20 contract that can be deployed on Ethereum, BSC, and Polygon using Ferrum's Quantum Portal. Once the contract is deployed, the same token can be accessed and traded on all these chains, and its supply can be easily managed through a single interface.

Here is an example of a Multichain token contract that can be deployed on Ethereum, BSC, and Polygon using Quantum Portal:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";

contract MultiChainToken is ERC20, Ownable {
    uint256 private constant INITIAL_SUPPLY = 1000000 * 10 ** decimals();

    constructor() ERC20("MultiChainToken", "MCT") {
        _mint(msg.sender, INITIAL_SUPPLY);
    }
}
```

With this contract, a developer can create a single token that can be deployed across multiple chains. This contract can be deployed on Ethereum, BSC, and Polygon using Quantum Portal, and the token can be accessed and traded on all these chains. Additionally, the supply of the token can be easily managed through a single interface, reducing the complexity and cost of managing token supply across multiple networks. This is a significant advantage for developers who want to build multichain applications as they can _**build once and deploy everywhere**_ without needing to worry about the complexities of managing tokens across multiple networks.

## A Developer First Toolset

Ferrum Network provides developers with a unique set of tools that enable them to build impactful web3 solutions without having to learn a new language for each new feature. This greatly simplifies the development process, as developers can focus on creating solutions rather than learning the syntax of yet another language.

One such tool is the MultiChain Token Standard, which allows developers to create tokens that can be deployed across multiple chains. This greatly simplifies the process of creating a token that works seamlessly across different networks. Developers can create a single token that can be used on multiple chains rather than having to create multiple versions of the same token for each individual chain.

In addition, Ferrum's Quantum Portal makes it easy for developers to deploy their solutions across multiple chains. This platform allows developers to deploy their smart contracts and dApps on a variety of chains without having to go through the cumbersome process of deploying and managing multiple versions of their solution on different chains.

This saves developers a significant amount of time and resources, as they can focus on building their solutions rather than managing multiple versions of their codebase. Furthermore, this allows developers to create more robust solutions that can be used by a wider audience, as their solutions can be easily deployed and used on a variety of networks.

Overall, Ferrum Network provides developers with the tools they need to create impactful web3 solutions without the headache of having to learn a new language for each new feature or manage multiple versions of their codebase. This greatly simplifies the development process, enabling developers to focus on what they do best: building innovative solutions that solve real-world problems.

## Challenging the Tripple Constraint Triangle

Projects can take advantage of Ferrum's innovative solution to deploy their dApps on multiple EVM and non-EVM networks without having to hire developers with expertise in different languages.

This solution offers significant cost savings for projects. Typically, if a project owner wants to launch a dApp that takes advantage of the unique features of multiple blockchain networks, they would need to hire developers with specific expertise for each network. For example, they would need a PyTeal developer for Algorand, a Cosmos developer for Cudos, a RUST developer for Solana, a Solidity developer for Ethereum, and a Substrate developer for Polkadot.

However, with Ferrum Network's solution, projects can hire developers with a single set of expertise with Substrate developers who can deploy contracts on as many integrated chains as they desire. This significantly reduces costs and increases efficiency and speed to complete and launch multichain dApps.

An example of this can be seen with the use of Quantum Portal and Multichain tokens. With Quantum Portal, a project owner can deploy a multichain staking smart contract in Solidity that can be deployed through Quantum Portal and Ferrum Network, as well as deploy client contracts on chains like Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, and others. Users can stake on Ethereum and withdraw rewards on BSC or even Polygon. This allows for cross-chain functionality without the need for specific developers for each chain.

In summary, Ferrum Network and Quantum Portal's innovative solution offers projects the ability to build once and deploy everywhere, significantly reducing costs and increasing efficiency and speed to complete and launch multichain dApps. By utilizing the expertise of Substrate developers and the cross-chain functionality of Quantum Portal, projects can take advantage of the unique features of multiple blockchain networks without the need for specific developers for each chain.
